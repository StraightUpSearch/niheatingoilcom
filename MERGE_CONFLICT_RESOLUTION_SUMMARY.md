# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
PR #3 had merge conflicts between `cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652` and `main` branch.

## Conflict Details
**File**: `client/src/components/enhanced-pricing-table.tsx`
**Lines**: 9-17

### What each branch had:
1. **cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652 branch** added:
   - Import for centralized pricing utilities: `@shared/pricing`
   - Import for loading skeletons: `@/components/loading-skeletons`

2. **main branch** added:
   - Import for `PriceLockFeature` component

## Resolution
✅ Kept ALL imports from both branches because they're all needed:
```typescript
import LeadCaptureModal from "./lead-capture-modal";
// Import centralized pricing utilities
import { calculateVolumePrice, formatPrice, formatPricePerLitre } from "@shared/pricing";
// Import loading skeletons
import { PriceTableSkeleton, PriceCardSkeleton } from "@/components/loading-skeletons";
// Import price lock feature
import PriceLockFeature from "./price-lock-feature";
```

## Additional Fixes
✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS color naming issue found by bot:
- Changed all instances of `grey` to `gray` in:
  - `loading-skeletons.tsx`
  - `enhanced-pricing-table.tsx`
  - `customer-avatars.tsx`

## Current Status
- File is properly resolved locally
- No conflict markers remain
- All imports are included
- Color naming is fixed
- Waiting for Jamie to push changes when they wake up

## Note
The `PriceLockFeature` component appears to be missing from the project, which will cause a linter error. This component should be added from the main branch or created if it doesn't exist.
