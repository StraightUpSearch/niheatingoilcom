# Instructions to Push Your Resolved Changes

Good morning Jamie! ðŸ‘‹ Here's exactly what you need to do to push your resolved changes:

## Step 1: Switch to the correct branch
```bash
git checkout cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652
```

## Step 2: Pull the latest changes from main to trigger the conflict locally
```bash
git pull origin main
```

You'll probably see a message about merge conflicts. That's expected!

## Step 3: Check the status
```bash
git status
```

## Step 4: Since we already resolved the conflict in the file, just add it
```bash
git add client/src/components/enhanced-pricing-table.tsx
```

## Step 5: Also add the other files we fixed (the gray/grey color fixes)
```bash
git add client/src/components/loading-skeletons.tsx
git add client/src/components/customer-avatars.tsx
```

## Step 6: Complete the merge
```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts and fix Tailwind color names"
```

## Step 7: Push everything to GitHub
```bash
git push origin cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652
```

## What happens next:
- GitHub will automatically update your PR
- The conflicts will disappear
- The bot will re-check for issues
- You'll be able to merge!

## If you get any errors:
If git says "nothing to commit", it means the changes are already committed. Just run:
```bash
git push origin cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652
```

If it says you're behind, run:
```bash
git pull origin cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652
git push origin cursor/review-and-optimize-code-for-mvp-9652
```

Good luck! You've got this! ðŸš€
