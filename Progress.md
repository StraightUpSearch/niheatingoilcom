## Current MVP Status
- **Core Features**: 85% complete
- **User Experience**: 80% complete
- **Backend Infrastructure**: 90% complete
- **Production Readiness**: 70% complete

## Priority Items for MVP Launch
1. Complete password reset functionality
2. Implement email notifications for leads and alerts
3. Add comprehensive error monitoring (Sentry)
4. Complete API documentation
5. Setup production monitoring and alerting
6. Create user onboarding flow
7. Implement basic analytics tracking

## Notes
- Project has solid foundations with comprehensive features
- Focus areas: Email notifications, testing, and production deployment
- Strong foundation for scaling and adding premium features
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Conservative API usage implemented (weekly scraping)
=======
- Core MVP functionality is still in progress, particularly around account management features.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Oil Price Data Caching
- Implemented a local cache (`data/oil_prices_cache.json`) for oil price data in development/mock mode.
- If the cache is missing or older than 7 days, the system falls back to Consumer Council price averages.
- This ensures realistic prices are always shown and prevents excessive API calls.
