## 🎯 How Deployment Works

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development** (Local by Flywheel)
   ```
   Site: niheatingoil.local
   Edit files in: wp-content/themes/ni-heating-oil-theme/
   ```

2. **Build Assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Creates optimized production files in `/dist/public/`

3. **Git Commit** (Optional - Version Control)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Push to Live** (Local by Flywheel)
   - Open Local app
   - Select site
   - Click "Push to Live"
   - Wait for sync (1-3 min)

5. **Verify**
   - Visit https://niheatingoil.com
   - Check pricing data loads
   - Verify logo displays

## 🏗️ Technical Stack (Live)

### Frontend
- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript 5.6.3
- Vite 5.4.14
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- Wouter (routing)
- TanStack Query (data fetching)

### Backend
- WordPress (latest)
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL/MariaDB

### Optional Backend (Not Currently Used)
- Express.js
- Node.js
- SQLite/PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM

---

## 🔄 Fallback System Logic

```php
// functions.php (lines 367-451)

1. API request comes to /api/prices or /api/suppliers
2. WordPress tries to reach Express backend at localhost:5000
3. Timeout after 5 seconds
4. If backend unavailable:
   → Return default pricing data
   → User sees 5 suppliers with realistic prices
5. If backend available:
   → Return live data from Express
```

**Key Benefit**: Site ALWAYS works, even if Express backend is down
