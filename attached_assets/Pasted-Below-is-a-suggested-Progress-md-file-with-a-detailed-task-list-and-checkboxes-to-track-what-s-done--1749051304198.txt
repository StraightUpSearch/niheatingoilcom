# Progress

This file tracks the key tasks and features for the NI Heating Oil Price Comparison Tool. Completed items are marked with ✔️; pending ones have an empty checkbox.

## 1. Data Collection & Integration
- [✔️] Identify local heating oil suppliers (list compiled)
- [✔️] Confirm contact points or APIs for price data
- [✔️] Fetch live pricing from Supplier A
- [✔️] Fetch live pricing from Supplier B
- [ ] Fetch live pricing from Supplier C
- [ ] Normalise price formats (e.g. pence per litre)
- [ ] Implement fallback logic if a supplier’s API is down

## 2. Backend Development
- [✔️] Set up repository and basic folder structure
- [✔️] Initialise Node.js backend (Express)
- [ ] Create database schema for suppliers, prices, user data
- [ ] Develop API endpoint: GET /prices/latest
- [ ] Develop API endpoint: GET /suppliers
- [ ] Implement scheduled job to refresh prices every hour
- [ ] Add caching layer (Redis or in-memory) to reduce API calls
- [ ] Add error handling and logging for data fetch failures

## 3. Frontend Development
- [✔️] Initialise React frontend
- [ ] Design homepage layout (header, price comparison table)
- [ ] Implement price comparison table component
- [ ] Create supplier filter (e.g. checkboxes to show/hide suppliers)
- [ ] Add search bar to filter suppliers by name
- [ ] Show timestamp of last data update
- [ ] Ensure responsive layout for mobile screens
- [ ] Add loading spinners while fetching data
- [ ] Handle “no data available” state gracefully

## 4. User Authentication & Profiles
- [ ] Design user flow: sign up, log in, password reset
- [ ] Implement registration endpoint: POST /auth/register
- [ ] Implement login endpoint: POST /auth/login (JWT-based)
- [ ] Protect “favourites” endpoint for authenticated users
- [ ] Frontend: Create sign-in and sign-up forms
- [ ] Allow users to save preferred suppliers or price alerts
- [ ] Add email verification on registration

## 5. Price Alert System
- [ ] Design data model for price alert rules (e.g. max price threshold)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: POST /alerts/create
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: GET /alerts/user/:id
- [ ] Create background worker to check alerts every 30 minutes
- [ ] Send email notification when an alert condition is met
- [ ] Frontend: Build “Create Alert” form and list user’s alerts

## 6. Admin & Supplier Dashboard
- [ ] Create admin login and role-based access control
- [ ] Admin: View supplier list, add/edit/remove suppliers
- [ ] Admin: Manual override for a supplier’s price if API is down
- [ ] Supplier: Secure login for supplier to update own prices manually
- [ ] Frontend: Build admin dashboard UI (supplier management page)
- [ ] Frontend: Build supplier portal (update price form)

## 7. Quality Assurance & Testing
- [✔️] Write unit tests for data-fetch modules
- [ ] Write integration tests for backend endpoints
- [ ] Set up end-to-end tests (e.g. Cypress) for critical user flows
- [ ] Peer review of codebase for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG compliance)

## 8. Deployment & Hosting
- [✔️] Choose hosting platform (e.g. Heroku or DigitalOcean)
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run tests and deploy
- [ ] Set up environment variables for API keys, database URL
- [ ] Provision production database (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL certificate
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts (CPU usage, error rates)

## 9. Documentation
- [✔️] Create ReadMe.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Document backend API (Swagger/OpenAPI spec)
- [ ] Document frontend component library (if any)
- [ ] Write developer guide: how to run, test and deploy locally
- [ ] Prepare user guide for non-technical users (how to compare prices, set alerts)

## 10. Additional Enhancements (Missing Items)
- [ ] Implement unit conversion (litres ↔ gallons) for users who prefer different units
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle in frontend
- [ ] Integrate map view to show supplier locations
- [ ] Add “average price trend” graph on homepage
- [ ] Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse of APIs
- [ ] Add GDPR cookie consent banner and privacy policy link
- [ ] Gather user feedback via a simple form (to prioritise next features)
Notes:

I’ve grouped tasks by area (data, backend, frontend, etc.).

All implemented items carry a ✔️. Pending or newly identified tasks remain unchecked.

This list should be reviewed regularly. Whenever a developer or AI agent completes a task, simply replace [ ] with [✔️].

If you think of any other missing piece—such as security audits, performance profiling or localisation—add it under “Additional Enhancements.”

Feel free to adjust or expand any section as needed.
