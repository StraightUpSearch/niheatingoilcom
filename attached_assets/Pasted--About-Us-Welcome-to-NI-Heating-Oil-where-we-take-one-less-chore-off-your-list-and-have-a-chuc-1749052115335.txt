## About Us

Welcome to NI Heating Oil—where we take one less chore off your list (and have a chuckle along the way).

I’m [Your Name], a Northern Irish SEO enthusiast who spent countless hours hunting down the best heating oil prices online. It occurred to me: why should everyone else have to do the same? So I decided to build a simple, AI‐powered platform just for our corner of the world.

My entire family still lives in Northern Ireland, which meant that creating this site gave me a perfect excuse to reconnect with them. Dad, who’s volunteered with Simon Community NI for years, immediately saw the potential. Over cups of tea, he asked, “Is there a way we can use AI to tackle a truly NI-specific problem?” My SEO brain sprang into action: “Oil prices. Let’s compare them, automatically, for every BT postcode!” And just like that, NIHeatingOil.com was born.

### Why We Do It
- **Community First:** Dad’s work with Simon Community NI inspired us to include a 5 % pledge toward heating grants for families in need. Every litre you order helps someone stay snug this winter.
- **Family Fun:** Building this site meant late-night Zooms with Gran, banter with Auntie Mae, and my brother teaching me how to make the perfect scone. Those moments remind us that even chores—like finding the best oil deal—can be done with a grin.
- **Local Focus:** We know Northern Ireland inside out. From Belfast to Enniskillen, we’ve scraped, sorted, and polished data from 50+ suppliers so you don’t have to. Enter your “BT” postcode, pick your litres, and let us handle the rest.

### How It Works
1. **Type “BT” + your postcode** into our search bar.
2. **Choose your volume** (300 L, 500 L, 900 L—your call).
3. **See the latest prices** from local suppliers, updated every two hours.
4. **Sit back and save**—you’ll know you’ve got the cheapest, most transparent deal in town.

### Our Promise
- **No hidden fees.** Ever.  
- **Data you can trust,** refreshed regularly.  
- **A bit of Northern Irish humour** to brighten your day.

We’re here to make one small part of life in NI a little easier and a lot more fun. Thanks for stopping by—now go compare those prices, save a few quid, and tell Dad we said hello next time you volunteer with Simon Community NI.

Stay warm,  
[Your Name] & the NI Heating Oil Team
