Statistics as at May 2020[1]
The BT postcode area, also known as the Belfast postcode area,[2] covers all of Northern Ireland and was the last part of the United Kingdom to be coded, between 1970 and 1974.[citation needed] This area is a group of 82 postcode districts in Northern Ireland, within 44 post towns and around 47,227 live postcodes.

With a population of over 1.8 million people, BT is the second most populous UK postcode area, after the B postcode area (Birmingham, 1.9 million). It is the only UK postcode area that has land borders with non-UK postcode areas and is also the only UK postcode area that borders the European Union. BT borders nine Eircode routing areas in the neighbouring Republic of Ireland: F94, F93, F91, N41, H23, H18, H14, A91, and A75.

Mail for the BT postcode area is processed at the Northern Ireland Mail Centre in Newtownabbey.

Coverage
Belfast
Prior to the introduction of postcodes, Belfast had already been divided into numbered postal districts, for example, Belfast 12.[3] Today, the Belfast post town covers postcode districts BT1 to BT17 and part of BT29. In common with all addresses in Northern Ireland, Belfast postcodes start with the letters BT, a mnemonic of the capital city's name. The commercial centre of the city is designated BT1 and the surrounding districts form a roughly sequential clockwise ring around the city. The postcode of the Royal Mail offices at Tomb Street in Belfast is BT1 1AA.
