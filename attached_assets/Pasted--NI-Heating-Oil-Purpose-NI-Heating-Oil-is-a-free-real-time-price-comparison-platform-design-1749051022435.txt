# NI Heating Oil

## Purpose
NI Heating Oil is a free, real-time price‐comparison platform designed to help Northern Ireland residents find the best deals on home heating oil. By aggregating live pricing from 50+ verified local suppliers and refreshing data every two hours, the platform ensures users see the most up-to-date, postcode‐specific rates.  

## Goals
- **Transparency:** Provide a completely free service that surfaces current heating oil prices from multiple trusted suppliers.
- **Savings:** Enable homeowners and businesses to compare 300 L, 500 L, and 900 L quotes by BT postcode, eliminating guesswork and manual price-checking calls.
- **Convenience:** Offer instant postcode‐based quotes, price‐drop alerts, and historical trend charts so users can make informed purchasing decisions.
- **Community Impact:** Pledge 5 % of profits to Simon Community NI’s emergency heating‐grant program, reinforcing our commitment to helping families in fuel hardship.

## Mission
To keep Northern Ireland’s homes warm, budgets intact, and communities connected by delivering a simple, reliable, and transparent tool for comparing heating oil prices—while using our platform to support those most vulnerable to fuel poverty.

## Monetization Strategy
1. **Affiliate Partnerships & Referral Fees**  
   - Earn a small commission on each completed order forwarded to partner suppliers.  
   - Maintain full transparency: users always see the same “list price,” with any referral fee built into supplier arrangements (no hidden markups).

2. **Premium “Pro” Features (Freemium Upgrade)**  
   - **Advanced Analytics & Forecasting:** AI-powered price forecasts and personalised “best‐time‐to‐buy” notifications.  
   - **Ad‐Free Experience:** Remove all on-page ads or sponsored listings for power users.  
   - **Group‐Buy Coordination:** Facilitate collective buying (“Oil Club” style) with volume discounts for neighbourhood clusters.  
   - Subscriptions priced at a modest monthly or annual rate to justify ongoing data-science enhancements.

3. **Sponsored Placement (Limited & Clearly Labeled)**  
   - Allow suppliers to appear as “Recommended Partners” (marked clearly) for users who prefer direct ordering through our system.  
   - Maintain a strict “no pay‐for‐position” policy in the core comparison table to protect user trust.  

4. **Display & Content Ads (Optional & Non-Intrusive)**  
   - Run Google-AdSense banners or relevant sponsored content in dedicated sections (e.g., blog posts, resource pages), rather than within the main price grid.

  - Seasonal “Winter Wish List” call-outs (October–February) linking directly to Simon Community NI’s campaign page.

- **Order Confirmation Messaging**

    “Thank you! You’ve helped fund a heating grant with Simon Community NI.”  
  - Include an optional “Learn more” link back to the Giving Back page.

- **Social Sharing & Referral Tools**

## Technical Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend**  
  - React (component-based UI) with Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.  
  - Lightweight JavaScript modules for pop-ups, notifications, and social sharing.  
  - React Router for client-side routing (homepage, compare page, dashboard, Giving Back page).

- **Backend & Data Scraping**  
  - Python (Scrapy, BeautifulSoup) or Node.js scripts to scrape supplier websites.  
  - Cron or serverless functions to run scrapes every two hours.  
  - API layer (Node.js/Express or Python Flask/Django) exposing:  
    - `/api/prices?postcode=BT7` → returns latest price table for that postcode.  
    - `/api/impact` → returns JSON of aggregate charity impact (quarterly grants funded, total donation).  
    - `/api/enquiry` → accepts new ticket submissions (name, email, postcode, litres).  
    - `/api/alerts` → CRUD for user’s price-alert subscriptions.

- **Database & Storage**  
  - PostgreSQL (relational data for users, tickets, alerts, impact metrics).  
  - Redis or in-memory caching layer for fast postcode lookups and temporary storage of scraped price feeds.  
  - S3 (or equivalent) for storing historical price-trend CSVs or chart images (if needed).

- **AI/ML Components (Future-Pro)**  
  - Python (TensorFlow or PyTorch) for predictive price-forecasting models (trained on historical price data, weather trends, global oil indices).  
  - Recommendation engine for “Best time to buy” signals.  
  - NLP-driven intelligence for adaptive scraping (auto-detect HTML changes on supplier sites).

- **Notifications & Emailing**  
  - SendGrid or Mailgun for transactional emails (enquiry confirmations, quote ready alerts, price alerts).  
  - Twilio for optional SMS or WhatsApp notifications (especially if users opt in for critical price-drop messages).

- **Analytics & Tag Management**  
  - Google Analytics 4 configured via Google Tag Manager for:  
    - Pageviews, form-submission events, share events, account registrations, and checkout conversions.  
  - Custom GTM tags for tracking “Compare Form Submit,” “WhatsApp Share Click,” and “Sign Up” conversions.
