AI Developer Brief: Heating Oil Price Comparison SaaS (Northern Ireland)
Overview
Build a SaaS platform that scrapes, compares, and presents heating oil prices from various Northern Irish suppliers, enhancing user experience through intuitive UX/UI and AI-driven insights. The platform should replicate core functionalities of cheapestoil.co.uk but incorporate additional user-engagement features and predictive analytics.

Key Competitors & Models
CheapestOil.co.uk: Independent price comparator, scraping public data; no ordering.

BoilerJuice, FuelTool, ValueOils: Broker-style, quoting directly from supplier APIs; handling orders/payment.

Our platform will blend both approachesâ€”transparent price listings from scraping, with optional broker-style order facilitation through partnerships.

Data Collection Methods
Primary: Web-scrape publicly accessible price data from suppliers' websites (e.g., Bangor Fuels, Alfa Oils, Robinson Fuels).

Secondary: Integrate direct data feeds from willing suppliers (API-driven).

Platform Functionalities & UX/UI

Interactive Pricing Tables: Clear display of 300L, 500L, and 900L prices, sortable by supplier, price, or delivery speed.

Instant Quote Forms: Prominent, simple input fields (postcode, volume) generating real-time price comparisons.

Price Alerts and Notifications: Email/SMS/WhatsApp notifications for price drops and ordering reminders.

Account Dashboard: Order history, spend tracking, personalised usage analytics.

Trust & Transparency Elements: Supplier ratings, VAT-inclusive pricing clearly marked, secure payment badges.
