AI Developer Brief: Social Proof Pop-Up for NI Heating Oil Website
Objective:
Develop a lightweight, non-intrusive pop-up notification on our MVP website (niheatingoil.com) to enhance user engagement through social proof, showcasing real-time (or simulated) usage data.

Core Functionality:
Social proof notifications: A small, animated pop-up appearing at the bottom-left or bottom-right corner of the screen, cycling through statements such as:

"Jane from Belfast just saved ¬£20/year using our heating oil comparison!"

"Mark from Derry saved ¬£18 on his oil bill today!"

"Lisa from Lisburn compared oil prices and reduced her annual bill by ¬£22!"

Localization:
Notifications must specifically reference familiar Northern Irish locations (e.g., Belfast, Derry, Armagh, Lisburn, Enniskillen, Antrim).

Authenticity and Appeal:
Messages should be short, believable, friendly, and tailored to resonate with Northern Irish users. Use common Northern Irish names to build credibility.

Technical Requirements:
Timing and Animation:

Notifications appear approximately every 20-30 seconds and auto-dismiss after 5-8 seconds.

Minimal animation (fade-in, fade-out, subtle slide-up from bottom).

Mobile & Desktop Responsiveness:
Ensure notifications function smoothly across all devices without impacting site performance or usability.

Accessibility:
Pop-up notifications should be dismissible with an intuitive "X" button.

Best Practices to Follow:
UX Best Practices:

Keep notifications concise, clear, and non-disruptive.

Ensure readability with good contrast and minimal animation.

Avoid frequent or overly aggressive pop-ups to prevent annoyance.

Data Privacy:

Clearly indicate that these notifications are representative, especially if initially using simulated data.

Ensure compliance with GDPR by not using actual users' full identifiable details unless explicitly consented.

Performance and SEO:

Maintain low-impact scripts to preserve fast page-loading speeds.

Do not negatively affect SEO or overall site accessibility.

Implementation Notes:
Given this is an MVP, it's acceptable initially to randomize names, locations, and savings amounts from a predefined list.

Ensure this feature can easily scale or later integrate with real-time usage data as the platform grows.

This brief clearly outlines the feature for the AI developer to implement a simple, engaging social-proof notification to encourage user trust and interaction on the NI Heating Oil comparison site.

üó£Ô∏è Integrating Northern Irish Slang and Humour into Branding
Objective:
Enhance user engagement by embedding authentic Northern Irish expressions and humour into the website's content, particularly in pop-up notifications and other interactive elements.

Approach:

Use of Local Slang in Notifications:

Craft pop-up messages that reflect local speech patterns and colloquialisms.

Examples:

"Sarah from Derry just saved ¬£25 on her heating oil ‚Äì dead on!"

"Big Tom from Belfast says, 'That's some quare deal!' after comparing prices."

Leverage the region's unique sense of humour to make messages more engaging.

Examples:

"Mary from Armagh is chuffed to bits with her ¬£30 savings ‚Äì fair play to her!"

"Joe from Lisburn reckons he's 'suckin' diesel' after finding the best deal."

Dynamic Content Generation:

Develop a system that randomly combines names, locations, and savings amounts to create varied and authentic-sounding messages.

Ensure the content remains appropriate and resonates with the local audience.

Cultural Sensitivity:

While humour is encouraged, avoid phrases that might be considered offensive or politically sensitive.

Focus on universally appreciated humour and expressions.

Technical Implementation:

Frontend:

Use JavaScript to create and display pop-up notifications at intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).

Ensure the pop-ups are responsive and do not obstruct essential content.

Backend:

Maintain a database of names, locations, and phrases to generate dynamic content.

Implement logic to randomly select and combine elements for each notification.

Accessibility:

Ensure that the pop-ups are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers.

Provide options to dismiss or disable notifications if desired.

"Emma from Enniskillen just nabbed a cracking deal ‚Äì saved ¬£20 on her heating oil!"

"Liam from Newry says, 'That's a belter of a bargain!' after comparing prices."
